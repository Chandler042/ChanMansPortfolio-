For week 2 homework I struggled a little with the layout and big time with the flex boxes.
With the layout I really just struggled with getting my section text to the right of my Headers (About Myself).
Flex box just was not working and I didn't understand it, I understood how to make a generic 6 box one but making one bigger then the rest and on its own row i struggled with.
I know it doesn't seem like alot I did but i spent hours trying to get the flex box to work and I could not, but I am going to get it down and return in this assignment just not before saturday. 
If you all have any tips on how to go about getting my flex boxes added I will take all the help in the world.
Sorry for not having a completed version.
