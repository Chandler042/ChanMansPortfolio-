                <p>
                I am a 25 year old that graduated from Appalachian State University up in Boone, NC. While in school I studied a concentration of
                Chemistry and majored in Fermentation Science. Moved back to Atlanta after school to start my career in Chemistry working for a 
                company called Pace Analytical as a Lab Technician 1. I am now entering my second year working for Pace, but want to expand my 
                knowledge into the tech industry.
